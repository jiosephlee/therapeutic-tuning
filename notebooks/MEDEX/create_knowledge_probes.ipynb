    "### Example 3\n",
    "**Fact:** Phosphate buffer at 100 mM is used as the incubation medium for both diaphorase and coupled enzyme assays.\n",
    "**Separator:** \"and\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4\n",
    "**Fact:** Sodium hydroxide, in combination with zinc sulfate, is more effective than perchloric acid for protein precipitation from blood.\n",
    "**Separator:** \"from\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 5\n",
    "**Fact:** Zinc sulfate, when combined with sodium hydroxide, is more effective than perchloric acid for protein precipitation from blood and removes inhibitory substances and interfering pigments retained after perchloric acid treatment.\n",
    "**Separator:** \"after\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 6\n",
    "**Fact:** Sodium hydroxide is used in a protein precipitation method with zinc sulfate for the recovery of formate from blood samples.\n",
    "**Separator:** \"from\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 7\n",
    "**Fact:** Trichloroacetic acid is inhibitory to the coupled reaction for formate determination and acts competitively with formate.\n",
    "**Separator:** \"with\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 8\n",
    "**Fact:** Methanol poisoning in monkeys can be monitored by measuring blood formic acid levels using a formate dehydrogenase-based enzymatic assay.\n",
